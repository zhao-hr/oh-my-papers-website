# Details about The Implementation of Back-End in this Repo

In this repo, I didn't complete a thorough back-end of "oh my papers". It is just a simple test.

If the string received from front-end is "resnet", return the content of "resnet.json" as a string to the front-end. Otherwise, return the content of "ohmypapers.json".
